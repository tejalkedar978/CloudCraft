As consumers become more health-conscious, they are increasingly opting for alternatives to traditional fried potato chips, which are typically high in fats and calories. Non-fried chips, which are often baked or air-popped, are gaining popularity due to their lower fat content and the growing trend of "clean eating."

Additionally, innovative flavor offerings and packaging solutions are attracting new customers to the market. The global market for non-fried potato chips is expected to continue expanding in both developed and emerging markets, as manufacturers innovate to meet the evolving demands of health-conscious consumers.</p> <p><strong></strong></p> <p>The non-fried potato chips market is being influenced by several key factors. Health trends continue to be a major driver, as consumers are more aware of the negative health implications associated with overconsumption of fried foods. This is particularly relevant in regions like North America and Europe, where the demand for healthier snacks is increasing. In addition, the growing availability of non-fried potato chips in supermarkets, convenience stores, and online platforms has made these products more accessible to a wider audience. Marketing efforts by brands to position non-fried chips as a guilt-free indulgence are also helping to expand their consumer base.</p> <p>The shift toward plant-based eating habits is another growth driver, as plant-based snacks are becoming a mainstream choice among millennials and Gen Z.
